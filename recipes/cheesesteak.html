    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ pounds beef chuck roast (should be very well-marbled)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons barbecue dry rub</li>
        <li>½ cup Kansas City style BBQ sauce</li>
        <li>4 sandwich or hoagie rolls</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container cheese whiz, or sliced cheese as needed</li>
        <li>⅔ cup sautéed onions</li>
        <li>⅔ cup chopped jarred pickled peppers</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sliced green onions</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Preheat your grill with a griddle pan or flat top griddle to medium-high heat, aiming for a temperature range of 350-400 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>While the grill is heating up, melt Cheez-Whiz in a small pot on a side burner or stovetop. Alternatively, you can melt it in the microwave following the package directions. Keep it warm until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Once the griddle is hot, add butter and onions. Season the onions generously with Brisket Rub and cook them until they're softened and lightly charred, which should take around 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the onions are cooking, toast your sub rolls cut side down on the griddle until they're nicely toasted.</li>
        <li>Move the cooked onions to the side of the griddle and add the burnt ends. Chop and break them up on the griddle and sear for a minute or two before mixing them in with the onions. If you need directions on making burnt ends, let me know!</li>
        <li>Apply a layer of the melted Cheez-Whiz to the toasted roll.</li>
        <li>Load up the roll with the beef and onions mixture, then add some more Cheez-Whiz on top.</li>
        <li>Grab a stack of napkins because it's time to enjoy your delicious grilled cheesesteak sandwich!</li>
      </ul>
